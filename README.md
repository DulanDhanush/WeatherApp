# WeatherApp
A simple weather app built with vanilla JavaScript that fetches real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search any city to view current temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and emoji-based visuals. Built to practice API integration, async/await, and DOM manipulation.
