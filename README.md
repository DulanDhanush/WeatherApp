# 🌦️ Weather App

This is a **small learning-focused project** built to practice and strengthen my fundamentals in **JavaScript** and **API integration**. The goal of this project is not to showcase a complex application, but to clearly demonstrate the concepts and skills I gained while learning frontend development.
